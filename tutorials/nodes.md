#### Nodes
An automation flow consists of nodes. Nodes are the basic building blocks of any flow. 

You can see the list of default nodes at the left side panel in Flow Designer.

You can drag & drop a node into the canvas or you can right click in the canvas to add a new node.

When you click on any node you will see the properties of that node.
