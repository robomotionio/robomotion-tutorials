### Native Scripting Language Support

Robomotion Flow Designer is a visual drag & drop development tool. 

If you need scripting support in your flows, you can use **Javascript** with the Function node.

You can manipulate the message object or read / write variables.

After changing the msg object, Function script must return the msg object;

`return msg`
