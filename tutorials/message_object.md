### What is message object?
Robomotion flows consist of nodes that are interconnected together through wires.

These nodes exchange data between each other with a message object.

A message object is a **JSON** object that has properties. These properties are either used by nodes as an input
or added by the nodes while passing this object to the next node connect.
