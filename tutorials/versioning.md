#### What is Versioning For?
Developing automation flows takes time and multiple iterations to make it work. You schedule them and discover errors,
go back to the flow again and again to fix the problem.

While working on these iterations, it may be a good idea to keep old versions of your flows. It is just tagging
your flows at the time of the versioning with a name and description.

#### How to create a version?
Every flow has default version named "master". This is the main version of all the flows. You can continue developing your flows,
and every save overwrites the master version.

To create versions just click the button right next to project name.
