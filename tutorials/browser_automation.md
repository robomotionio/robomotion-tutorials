#### What is Browser Automation?
Robots can use a browser to do repetitive tasks. It can login to a portal, navigate through menus and then fillout a form and submit.
Or it can export a report to process later.

#### Browser Nodes
The default browser nodes would be enough to cover all your web automation needs.

#### Run Script
There is also a very powerful node in the Browser package and that is the Run Script node. With this node you can execute a Javascript code in a web page. This comes handy in complex cases. Because this Javascript code runs in the browser, you can do anything that is not covered or possible by the default browser nodes.
