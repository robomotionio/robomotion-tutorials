#### What is Browser Automation?
Robots can use a browser to do repetitive tasks. It can login to a portal, navigate through menus and then fillout a form and submit.
Or it can export a report to process later.

#### Browser Nodes
The default browser nodes are enough to cover all your automation needs.

#### Run Script
There is a very powerful node that is Run Script. With this node you can execute a Javascript code within the browser page. This comes
handy in complex cases. Because this Javascript code runs in the browser, you can do anything that is not covered by the default browser nodes.
